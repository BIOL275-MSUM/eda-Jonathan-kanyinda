# Investigation of Different Causes of Infant Mortality in the United States

## Abstract 


Infant mortality in the United States is one of the less discussed topics in general. However, it affects a lot of families and communities in the country. In this report, infant mortality based on the data from the year 2018 by age, maternal race, gestational age and maternal state of residence have been investigated. Descriptive tabulations as well as graphs are reported and interpreted for infant death mortality using the 2018 period linked birth/infant datafile that is based on birth and death certificates registered in all states and the district of Columbia. More than 20,000 infant deaths were reported in 2018. The infant mortality rate declined by 4 % in comparison to 2017, and regardless of the differences investigated, in general the mortality rate has been trending down since 1995. I will do an exploratory analysis to investigate the relation between race, gestational age and state of residence with infant mortality

## Introduction


Infant mortality is the death of children under the age of one year. This topic is often overlooked because it is believed that women get pregnant, give birth, children grow to become men and women. However, this is not always the case, there are multiple cases of infant deaths recored in the United States and reported to the Center for Disease Control and preventionâ€™s National Center for Health Statistics and made available online (Data Access - Vital Statistics Online 2020), where over 3 million cases have been reported for the United States alone in the year. I believe that getting more understanding on the different causes of infant death is the first step in preventing it as it will provide us with specific areas to explore and improve.
Prevention can only be applied when there is knowledge of the risks and causes and one way to ensure a good prevention in any area is by educating people on the specific and or various subjects. Education tends to be overlooked when it comes to some situation, but even the general knowledge on a topic is better than the absence of any knowledge. By investigating the different outcomes and education levels, not only helps in avoiding assumptions, but it mainly provides valuable information about the ratio between the different education levels and therefore provide a starting point for improvement of both the education system and the provision of  ways to keep children in schools as well as for the other various probable causes.
This report presents infant mortality statistics based on the data from the 2018 period linked birth/infant death file. Infant mortality is described by maternal race, maternal age, marital status, education level, month, day and place of birth. This study has been made using collected data in the year 2018 of children under the age of 1 who had died. (Data Access - Vital Statistics Online 2020). This was done in the goal to further investigate the various causes of infant death.



## Methods 

### Data Acquisition 

In this analysis the data was obtained from public data files of the Center for Desease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistic at :https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/vitalstatsonline.htm#Period_Linked (Data Access - Vital Statistics Online 2020) and the selected data was from the  2017/2018 year as a Zipped file that was decompressed/expanded into the computer and there was a user guide provided that was used to collect the information of interrest(NCHS 2020). The first step was to obtain the files that were ziped in order to be able to explore them. After obtaining the file, the information was encoded as a "fixed width function" file and therefore I used the fwf function from the readr package (Wickham and Hester 2020). Next, the user guide helped to figure out which set rows contained specific information in order to be able to retrieve that information using the fwf function in R. 

### Data Preparation 

For the data analysis I used  RStudio version 1.2.5033 (R Core Team 2020) and R version 4.0.3
(R Core Team 2020) for wrangling and data analysis.
The data obtained was a set of numbers displayed in a table (table1) and the user guide provided
the correspondence and significance of each number. Therefore to better understand the  data, I created a word document in which I recorded the meaning of each number in the different categories of interest using the user guide as a reference and then proceeded to modify the values displayed in the inintial table (table1) using the as_factor function from the forcats package (Wickham 2020) function combined with the combine  function (c())  from the base package
(R Core Team 2020)  and then proceeded to print a new table (main_table).

## Discussion


This data is reliable as it was collected based on informations provided on birth certificates and makes it possible to study the causes of death in different regions, populations, races and even the different social statuses of people. In this Exploratory data analysis, the data provides a correlation between certain social and biological states based on the linked birth/infant mortality from the year 2018 published by the CDCâ€™s NHS.
Based on the different aspects investigated, there had been more cases in the most prevalent groups of individuals (e.g., whites (only)) this is because of the ratio in comparison to the other races (Figure 2). The average age of mothers giving birth is mostly common across the entire population (Figure 1) and thus there is a higher record number of infant deaths in that age range. And most birth have been given in hospitals (Figure 6) implying the assistance of a trained personnel and also  most of the recorded birth were given by married people (Figure 3) with babies of an average weigh of around 2000-2500 grams (Figure 10). There is a consistent pattern in the days of birth (Figure 7) and Month of birth (Figure 8)
From the education level perspective, it is noticeable that most infant deaths occurred in parents with lower education levels (Figure 5). The level of education is usually indicative of the lifestyle and the lower education levels usually result in less stable living situations and these could have negative effects on the pregnancies leading to infant death and justifying the lower infant death rate in hypothetically more stable lifestyles of more educated people. Out of all the trends observed, the most obvious is the education level as that can be related to the lifestyle and thus explain the not always adequate condition for pregnancy care, either financially and or having the knowledge of dispositions to take to ensure a good pregnancy  period.Therefore after investigating the exact ways in which education and other factors play a role, the next steps could be to develop ways to provide the general public with needed/required information and provide them with knowledge and access to the different resources available to them.
